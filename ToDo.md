# Stuff ToDO
- ***Support LTI Custom Parametres*** - so that the user will be able to interact and customise the LTI activity
- ***Dynamically change `PYLTI_CONFIG`*** - ie we must be able to add/remove consumers on the fly.
- Research alternate standards apart from LTI and figure out how to integrate them into our system.
